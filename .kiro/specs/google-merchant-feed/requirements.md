# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google Merchant XML Feed feature enables the e-commerce platform to automatically generate and maintain product feeds compatible with Google Merchant Center. This system will export product data from the existing Laravel application into standardized XML format that meets Google's product data specifications, allowing products to be displayed in Google Shopping ads and free listings.

The feature addresses the critical need for automated product data synchronization with Google's advertising platform, eliminating manual feed management and ensuring real-time product information accuracy across all sales channels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want the system to automatically generate Google Merchant XML feeds from our product catalog, so that our products can be displayed in Google Shopping without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs the feed generation process THEN it SHALL create a valid XML feed containing all active products with complete required attributes
2. WHEN a product has variants THEN the system SHALL export each variant as a separate item with proper item_group_id linking
3. WHEN a product lacks required Google Merchant attributes THEN the system SHALL apply fallback values or skip the product with appropriate logging
4. WHEN the feed generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the XML file to a configured storage location
5. IF the feed generation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and maintain the previous valid feed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want the feed to include accurate pricing and inventory information, so that customers see current prices and availability in Google Shopping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting product pricing THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate currency conversion based on the target market
2. WHEN a product has sale pricing active THEN the system SHALL include both regular price and sale_price with effective dates
3. WHEN checking product availability THEN the system SHALL set availability to "in_stock" if stock > 0 and is_active = true, otherwise "out_of_stock"
4. WHEN a product has campaign pricing THEN the system SHALL calculate the final price using the pricing service
5. IF pricing data is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use the most authoritative price source

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want the feed to include proper product categorization and attributes, so that products appear in relevant Google Shopping searches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting product categories THEN the system SHALL map internal categories to Google product taxonomy
2. WHEN a product has variant attributes (color, size) THEN the system SHALL include these in the appropriate Google Merchant fields
3. WHEN generating product titles THEN the system SHALL combine product name with variant attributes, truncated to 150 characters
4. WHEN a product lacks brand information THEN the system SHALL set identifier_exists to false or use configured fallback brand
5. IF Google category mapping is missing THEN the system SHALL use the internal category hierarchy as product_type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want the feed generation to run automatically on a schedule, so that product information stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scheduled feed generation runs THEN it SHALL execute daily at a configured time (default 03:00)
2. WHEN the feed generation starts THEN the system SHALL log the start time and process parameters
3. WHEN the feed generation completes THEN the system SHALL log success/failure status and processing statistics
4. WHEN feed generation fails THEN the system SHALL send notifications to configured administrators
5. IF the previous feed exists and new generation fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing feed file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want to validate feed quality and troubleshoot issues, so that I can ensure Google Merchant Center acceptance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feed is generated THEN the system SHALL validate XML structure against Google Merchant schema
2. WHEN validating product data THEN the system SHALL check for required fields and proper formatting
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log specific product IDs and error details
4. WHEN running feed validation manually THEN the system SHALL provide a command-line tool for testing
5. IF critical validation errors exceed threshold THEN the system SHALL prevent feed publication and alert administrators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want to configure feed settings and mappings, so that I can customize the export behavior for our specific business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the feed THEN the system SHALL allow setting target currency, language, and country parameters
2. WHEN mapping product attributes THEN the system SHALL support custom field mappings through configuration
3. WHEN setting up brand information THEN the system SHALL allow fallback brand configuration for products without explicit brands
4. WHEN configuring shipping THEN the system SHALL support default shipping rules and tax rates
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent feed generation and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an e-commerce administrator, I want to monitor feed performance and Google Merchant Center integration, so that I can optimize product visibility and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feed is published THEN the system SHALL track generation time, product count, and file size metrics
2. WHEN monitoring feed health THEN the system SHALL provide dashboard or logging for feed statistics
3. WHEN Google Merchant Center reports errors THEN the system SHALL facilitate correlation with internal product data
4. WHEN feed content changes significantly THEN the system SHALL log change summaries for audit purposes
5. IF feed metrics indicate problems THEN the system SHALL provide alerting mechanisms for proactive issue resolution
