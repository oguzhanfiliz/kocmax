## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Swagger Documentation Standards
Each endpoint must include:
- Complete parameter documentation
- Response schema definitions
- Error response examples
- Authentication requirements
- Request/response examples

### Validation Rules
- Use Form Request classes for complex validation
- Implement consistent error responses
- Add rate limiting for public endpoints
- Validate file uploads (size, type, security)

### Performance Considerations
- Implement eager loading for relationships
- Use API resources for consistent data transformation
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### Security Measures
- Sanctum authentication for protected routes
- Role-based authorization (B2B/B2C/Admin)
- Input sanitization and validation
- File upload security checks

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for service classes
- Feature tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Performance tests for high-traffic endpoints
